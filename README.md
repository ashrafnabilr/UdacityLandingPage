## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. This project needs to convert from a static page to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Files needed
To get started, make sure you have these 3 files: 
* `js/app.js` for Javascript changes.
* `css/styles.css` for all css formats and styles.
* `index.html` file for the landing page structuring.

## HTML file
The `index.html` file contains all the basic page layout and all the text that we want to show at the landing page in different sections and paragraphs.

## CSS file
This `styles.css` file contains all the sytles for our landing page as text font color or size, the page background and the navigation bar colors also. It basically has everything concerning the styling of the page that we want to apply to all the different HTML tags or classes in the `index.html` file.

## JavaScript file
Finally, the `app.js` file that actually contains all the required logic we need to make our page dynamic and be behave in a user friendly way as switching from section to section upon clicking on the required section from the nagivation bar or changing the layout of the nagivation bar upon hovering on which section and so on.
